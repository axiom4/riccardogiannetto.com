[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# E1101: Instance/class has no member (Django ORM false positives)
# R0801: Similar lines in different files (acceptable code patterns)
# R0903: Too few public methods (Django Meta classes, mixins, etc.)
# R0901: Too many ancestors (Django REST Framework ViewSets)
# W0212: Protected member access (Django _meta is part of public API)
# W0718: Broad exception (necessary for robust error handling)
# C0415: Import outside toplevel (Django pattern in manage.py)
